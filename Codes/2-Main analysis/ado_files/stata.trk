d 'ESTOUT': module to make regression tables
d 
d  estout produces a table of regression results from one or
d several models for use with spreadsheets, LaTeX, HTML, or a
d word-processor table. eststo stores a quick copy of the active
d estimation results for later tabulation. esttab is a wrapper for
d estout. It displays a pretty looking publication-style regression
d table without much typing. estadd adds additional results to the
d e()-returns for one or several models previously fitted and
d stored. This package subsumes the previously circulated esto,
d esta, estadd,  and estadd_plus. An earlier version of estout is
d available  as estout1.

d 'COEFPLOT': module to plot regression coefficients and other results
d 
d   coefplot plots results from estimation commands or Stata
d matrices. Results from multiple models or matrices can be
d combined in a single graph. The default behavior of coefplot is
d to draw markers for coefficients and horizontal spikes for
d confidence intervals. However, coefplot can also produce various
d other types of graphs.

d 'SCHEME-BURD': module to provide a ColorBrewer-inspired graphics scheme with qualitative and blue-to-red diverging colors
d 
d   The burd scheme is an alternative rendering of the s2color
d scheme based on Svend Juul's lean scheme and Cynthia Brewer's
d "RdBu" ColorBrewer scheme. The burd3 to burd11 sub-schemes
d provide blue-to-red diverging color scales for up to 11 data
d classes, which might be useful to plot ordered response scales in

d (https://db.nomics.world).  DB.nomics is a web-based platform
d that aggregates and maintains time series data from various
d statistical  agencies across the world.  dbnomics only works
d with Stata 14.0 or higher, since it relies on the secure HTTP
d protocol (https).    dbnomics provides an interface to DB.nomics'
d RESTful API (https://api.db.nomics.world/apidocs), allowing for
d the advanced filtering of    data using Stata's native options
d syntax.
